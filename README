The system is developed for monitoring the health condition of remote people with the use of body temperature (DS178B20), Heart rate and blood pressure (Sunrom Blood Pressure Sensor), and Blood Oxygen level (Pulse Oximeter). Raspberry Pi reads the sensor data and transmits them to the MySQL database for real-time monitoring of health condition. For detecting the severity of patient ESI (Emergency Severity Index) score will be calculated using sensor data with an ESI E-Triage algorithm and TRIAGE tag will be generated depends on the condition of a patient and CASE will be opened and assigned to one of the following depending on the condition of a patient: Emergency Doctor, General Practitioner or Physician. For real-time monitoring of the health condition of remote people, sensor data is displayed on the webpage can be seen either by Emergency Doctor, General Practitioner or Physician. In the telepresence, they can communicate with the patient using Audio, Video or Chat is implemented using WebRTC protocol and PHP WebSocket. They also can control the Mouse, Keyboard, and Screen of a Patient if the patient is not able to understand the sensor data.
